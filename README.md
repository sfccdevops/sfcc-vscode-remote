### :white_check_mark: Remote Container is Version Controlled

**This means you can Version Control your teams Dev Environment.**

Need to work on updating to a new version of Node? Need to update your Team's Linter or Code Formatting Rules? Maybe you want to try out a new VS Code Extension with your entire Team? No problem! Make a branch, change some settings in the container config, and VS Code will prompt anyone switching to that branch to rebuild their Dev Environment. When they switch back, their environment can as well.

### :white_check_mark: Cross-Platform Virtual Environment

**Not everyone works on macOS laptops!**

With our setup, you will be able to launch VS Code with a Virtual Environment to allow your Windows, macOS, and Linux Coders to access a consistent Dev Environment built explicitly for SFCC Projects.  There are no weird issues with cross-platform dependencies, managing different versions of Node, etc.

### :white_check_mark: Pair Programming for Entire Team

**Pair Programming and Group Chat Already Installed.**

Getting VS Code's Live Share & Live Share Audio to play well on one machine can be a challenge on its own, let alone your entire dev team.  With our Remote Container, we have everything set up for you.  We've also built-in better security than what is enabled by default.  So team members don't have to worry about anonymous guests joining a pair programming session.

### :white_check_mark: Run Custom DevOps Scripts

**Executing Commands on your Dev Environment from VS Code.**

There is always someone on your Dev Team creating handy DevOps tools to automate specific tasks.  Sometimes you want to remove all the node_modules folders and start life over.  We get it, and that's why we've baked in support for collecting your DevOps scripts and making them accessible via VS Code right from the Task Bar.


### :white_check_mark: Easy to Customize for Your Team

**Not every Dev Team works the same way, and that's OK.**

We've already sorted out the basics to ensure everything you need to do SFCC Dev Work is supported, but we realize every team is different. We've documented everything you need to know to customize which VS Code Extensions are best for your team and how to configure Linters and Code Formatters for your teams' needs.
